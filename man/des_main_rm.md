The Sap Flow Analyzer (SFA) is an R Shiny app to process sap flow data recorded with Heat Field Deformation (HFD) instruments. The app allows to clean the data, determine the parameter *K*, calculate the sap flow metrics (i.e., sap flow index, sap flow per section, sap flow density) and estimate sap flow rates and tree water use if tree properties are provided. 

A _default_ data set is stored in the app. It contains raw temperature data of 3 full days. The measurements were performed on a black mangrove (_Avicennia germinans_) tree in Mexico in 04/2022.
