#### Sap Flow Index, SFI

Raw symmetrical temperature difference *dTsym*.

"The ratio of predawn SFI to midday SFI and the period between the two daily SFI maxima [...] can be used to characterize internal plant water balance." (Nadezhdina, 1999)

#### Sap Flow per Section, SFS

Flux per tangential section (g &#8901; cm<sup>-1</sup> &#8901; h<sup>-1</sup> ). A "2D surrogate of sap flux density" (Nadezhdina, 2018).

SFS = 3600 &#8901; D<sub>nom</sub> &#8901; (K + dTsa) &#8901; dTas <sup>-1</sup> &#8901; Zax &#8901; Ztg<sup>-1</sup>

D<sub>nom</sub> ... thermal diffusivity

Zax ... distance between the axial sensor needle and the heater

Ztg ... distance between the tangential sensor needle and the heater


#### Sap Flow Density, SFD

Flux per unit of surface. A volume of fluid that is passing across a given area of sapwood per unit of time (g &#8901; cm<sup>-2</sup> &#8901; h<sup>-1</sup> ). 

SFD = SFS &#8901;  swd<sup>-1</sup> 

swd ... depth of sapwood
