The value *K* is the absolute value of the temperature difference at zero sap flow and is used to calculate sap flow based on recorded temperature measurements.
In zero flow conditions, *K* can be easily determined as intersection of dTas or dTsa with Y axis of a *K*-diagram. In the case of no zero- or low-flow conditions, the *K* can be extrapolated using regression.

**Procedure**

1. Select sensor position
2. Select *K* estimation method (default: _regression_)
3. Verify *K* estimation with _Control-diagram 1_ and _Control-diagram 2_ (see section _K-diagrams_)
4. Optional: Use filters to limit the data points used for regression (see figure _Diurnal flow_)
5. Set *K*
6. Repeat 1 - 5 for all sensor positions
