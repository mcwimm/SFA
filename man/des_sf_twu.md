Sap flow rate (SF) or total water use (TWU) by an individual tree accounting for tree size and attenuation of radial xylem flow.

Calculated based on three methods.

●	Method 1: Use the area of circular rings (SF<sub>i</sub> = SFD<sub>i</sub>  * A<sub>i</sub> )

●	Method 2: Use sapwood area (SF = <span style="text-decoration:overline">SFD</span> * A<sub>sw</sub> )

●	Method 3: Calculate circumference of circular rings (SF<sub>i</sub> = SFS<sub>i</sub>  * C<sub>i</sub> / n)



Methods 1 and 3 provide the fraction of tree water use in each annuli.

Daily balance and radial profile are estimated by the area under the curve of diurnal sap flow rates using the trapezoidal method.
