**Control-diagram 1**, *Figure (a)*

- 'dTsym' and 'K+dTsa' should intersect in the coordinate origin (red diamand)
- 'K+dTsa' becomes parallel to x-axis for higher 'dTsym/dTas'


**Control-diagram 2**, *Figure (b)*

- 'dTas' and 'dTsa' are plotted against the ratio 'dTsym/dTas' and 'R'
- 'dTas' and 'dTsa' plotted against the different x-axis values (yellow and grey) should intersect on the y-axis (red diamond)
