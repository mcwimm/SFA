The K-diagram  shows the relationship between temperature differences dTsym, dTas, dTs-a and the ratio dTsym /dTas, and allows for the extrapolation of zero flow conditions for K-value determination.  

Graph shows 24 hours of HFD data for a Quercus suber tree (Nadezhdina, 2018). Maximum values for dTsym /dTas correspond to maximum daily flow rates. In this example, K value is extrapolated to 1.7 Â°C. Arrow indicates difference between dTsym and (K+dTs-a).
