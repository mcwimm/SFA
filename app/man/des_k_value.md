The K value is the absolute value of the temperature difference at zero sap flow and is used to calculate sap flow based on recorded temperature measurements.
In zero flow conditions, K-values can be easily determined as intersection of dTas or dTs-a with Y axis of a K-diagram. In the case of no zero- or low-flow conditions, the K-value can be extrapolated using regression.

**Procedure**

1. Select sensor position
2. Select k estimation method (default: _regression_)
3. Verify k estimation with _Control-diagram 1_ and _Control-diagram 2_ (see section _K-diagrams_)
4. Optional: Use zero-flow time filter to limit the data points used for estimation (see figure _Diurnal flow_)
5. Set k-value
6. Repeat 1 - 5 for all sensor positions
