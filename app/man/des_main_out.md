The processed sap flow data can be saved if a project is created (see 'Project settings'). Output formats are

- csv files (i.e. sap flow density, sap flow rate, k-values)
- figures (pdf or jpg)

**Figure options**

For most figures the option `Facet wrap` is available. If enabled, the data are arranged in panels defined by a grouping variable such as 'day of the year' or 'sensor position'.

The `Scales` of plots can either be `fixed` or `free`. In case of facet wrap plots a `fixed` scale means that all panels have the same scale while a `free` scale allows individual scales for each panel. In case of simple plots, `fixed` scales allows the definition of min. and max. values for an axis.
