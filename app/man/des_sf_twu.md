Total daily water use or sap flow rate by an individual tree accounting for tree size and attenuation of radial xylem flow.

Calculated based on the area of each circular ring (method 1), sapwood area (method 2) or circumference of circular rings (method 3).


Method 1: SF<sub>i</sub> = SFD<sub>i</sub>  * A<sub>i</sub> 

Method 2: SF = <span style="text-decoration:overline">SFD</span> * A<sub>sw</sub> 

Method 1: SF<sub>i</sub> = SFS<sub>i</sub>  * C<sub>i</sub> / n


Methods 1 and 3 provide the fraction of tree water use in each annuli.

Daily balance and radial profile are estimated by the area under the curve of diurnal sap flow rates using the trapezoidal method.
